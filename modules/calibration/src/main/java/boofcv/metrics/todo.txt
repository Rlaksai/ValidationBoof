ComputeTargetEdgeScore

- Load targetToCamera transform
- Inputs
  * intrinsic
  * rectified image and targetToCamera
- visualize the line segments and CalibValidPoints in an image
- compute score as average difference
  * point on edge and point outside
- Do this for square grid too


Batch test:
* calibrate image
* compute calibration point reprojection error
* undistort and save transforms and new intrinsic
  - compute edge score
